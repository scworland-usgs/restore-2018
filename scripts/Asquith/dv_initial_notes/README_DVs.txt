This directory holds the original site list given to WHA in February 2017. The script is one used to pull in the DVs for this whole list and then whittle it back to the final count of 1,379 that is available elsewhere in this archive. The DVissues.txt contains some working notes on the final polishing of a few issues.  The script herein is not intended for continuous operation or it is intended for any future uses.
