Two streamgages for a distinct and differing decades (two records out of the 2,804 records in this data release) would have negative flood storage based on the nid_storage and norm_storage as continue to be reported in this data release as well as the original source (CITATION). For streamgage 02295420 and decade 2000, the computed flood storage from the raw data was about -1.02 meters, but the value for 1990 was about 0.12 meter and for 1980 was about 0.08 meter. For this study, the value for 2000 was assigned that of 1990 and thus held constant, in other words. For streamgage 02296750, the computed flood storage from the raw data was about -0.05 meter for 1980 was about 0.04 meter and for 1990 was about 0.048 meter. For this study, the value for 2000 was assigned as the absolute value based on an assumption that a data transcription error in original data sources might be involved.
