These are the L-moments of ***NONZERO*** flow.

lmr <- lmomco::vec2lmom(c(114.5072, 80.29483, 0.6901283, 0.5524655))
kap <- lmomco::lmom2par(lmr, type="kap") # estimate the kappa distribution
pplo <- 0.078 # probability of zero flow for the entire decade
FF <- seq(0.001,.999,by=.001) # convenience nonexceedance probabilities

To begin, naively plot the fitted distribution to the L-moments

plot(qnorm(FF), lmomco::qlmomco(FF, kap), type="l", log="y", xaxt="n",
     xlab="", ylab="QUANTILE, CFS")

but this curve is wrong and over estimates the low end! So now we plot the distribution
via a conditional probability offset or truncation. The key is in f2flo() and the
transform (f - pp)/(1 - pp), which maps a [pplo, 1] interval into a [0,1] for purposes of
computing the quantiles. For example, if the probability of zero flow is 0.078 as in this
example, then the first fitted quantile at 0.078+eps in the real work is the 0th-percent
probability in the fitted distribution world. (The domain on which the L-moments were
originally computed, which here means the nonzero flows.)
